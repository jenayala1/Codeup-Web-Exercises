    //ARRAY BONUS
    //Create a simple mad libs game which prompts the user to provide parts of speech to complete missing 
    //words of phrases for 3-4 silly sentences.  Add each word or phrase from each prompt to single array.
    //Once a user has entered all the Mad Libs, alert the results.
    //Use a confirm to play again or not. Validate user input to prevent blank entries.
    //At the very least, wrap your program in an IIFE function. Consider organizing your code into smaller
    //functions.

    //Bonus answer: MAD LIBS//
