// Object Basics Exercises

// #1 - Download objects.js and save it to the js folder.
// #2 - Create an HTML file named objects-intro-js.html.
// #3 - Make sure objects-intro-js.html has a <script> tag for objects.js.
// #4 - Open objects.js in your editor and complete the TODO items in the code.
// #5 - View the results in your browser to test for the expected output.
// #6 Finally, save your work, commit the changes to your git repository, and push to GitHub.

     * HEB has an offer for the shoppers that buy products amounting to more
     * than $200. Write a JS program, using conditionals, that logs to the
     * browser, how much does Ryan, Cameron and George need to pay. We know that
     * Cameron bought $180, Ryan $250 and George $320. Your program will have to
     * display a line with the name of the person, the amount before the
     * discount, the discount, if any, and the amount after the discount.
     *
     * Uncomment the lines below to create an array of objects where each object
     * represents one shopper. Use a foreach loop to iterate through the array,
     * and console.log the relevant messages for each person

// Working with Arrays Of Objects - Exercises

// #1. Continue working in your object.js file.
// #2. Copy and paste the code below as inline JavaScript and complete the todo items in the code.
// #3. View the results in your browser to test for the expected output.
// #4. Finally, save your work, commit the changes to your git repository, and push to GitHub.


// #5 todo:
// Create an array of objects that represent books.
// Each book should have a title and an author property.
// The author property should be an object with a firstName and lastName.
// Be creative and add at least 5 books to the array
// var books = [todo];

// log out the books array
// console.log(books);

// #6 todo:
// Loop through the array of books using .forEach and print out the specified information about each one.
// start loop here
    // console.log("Book #" + todo);
    // console.log("Title: " + todo);
    // console.log("Author: " + todo);
    // console.log("---");
// end loop here

// })();
