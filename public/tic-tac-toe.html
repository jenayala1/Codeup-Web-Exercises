<!-- ========== BONUS EXERCISE: TIC-TAC-TOE GAME ========================================================

1) Create a clickable tic-tac-toe board with creative styling changes by adding and removing classes
    (may add animation effects once we cover it in class)
   a. clicks should alternate between the unicode symbol for an X and circle when clicking the tiles
   b. the current playerâ€™s turn should be displayed after each click
   c. clicked tiles should no longer be clickable

2) **Hard Challenge** Make the tic-tac-toe game playable by detecting when a player gets three-in-a-row
   a. create a customized win message based on which player won
   b. change the css of the tiles that create the three-in-a-row winning pattern

3) ***EXTRA HARD CHALLENGE*** create a playable AI opponent that will play defensively if you are a click away from winning and offensively otherwise. -->
